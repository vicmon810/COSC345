## Project Overview:
Our goal is to create a user-friendly app that provides personalized movie recommendations and food suggestions to enhance the user's entertainment experience.

## Key Features:
1: Movie Recommendation: The app will analyze the user's movie preferences, ratings, and history to suggest new movies that align with their interests. It will consider factors like genre, cast, ratings, and release year.

2: Food Pairing Suggestions: In addition to movie recommendations, the app will suggest suitable food options that complement the user's selected movie. It will provide recipes based on the movie chosen.

## Current Implementation
Currently, the alpha version of the app is being made.
