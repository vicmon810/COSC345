# Movies and Food:
2023 Otago COSC345 Team Work: We are aiming to develop an application that recommends movies and suggests suitable food based on the user's preferences, mood, and movie history.

# Project Overview:
Our goal is to create a user-friendly app that provides personalized movie recommendations and food suggestions to enhance the user's entertainment experience. By leveraging user input, movie data, and mood analysis, our app will offer tailored recommendations and culinary ideas.

# Key Features:
1: Movie Recommendation: The app will analyze the user's movie preferences, ratings, and history to suggest new movies that align with their interests. It will consider factors like genre, cast, ratings, and release year.

2: Food Pairing Suggestions: In addition to movie recommendations, the app will suggest suitable food options that complement the user's selected movie and mood. It will provide recipes, restaurant suggestions, or delivery options based on the user's location and dietary preferences.
